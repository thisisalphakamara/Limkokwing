Developer Proposal: Web-Based Online Registration System
Project Title: Design and Implementation of a Web-Based Online Registration System for
Limkokwing University
1. Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement a secure, role-based web-based online
registration system for Limkokwing University. The system digitizes the student registration
process, eliminates unauthorized access, enforces faculty-based routing, and introduces a
structured approval workflow across academic and administrative departments.
2. Visual Design Requirement
The entire system must follow a strict black-and-white theme to reflect professionalism and
institutional branding. All interfaces, dashboards, forms, and controls must maintain visual
consistency without the use of bright colors.
3. User Roles
1 Student – submits semester registration and confirms modules
2 Year Leader – verifies academic eligibility within assigned faculty
3 Faculty Admin – confirms faculty and semester correctness
4 Finance Officer – verifies payment status
5 Registrar – creates student accounts and gives final approval
6 System Administrator – manages system configuration
4. Account Creation Policy
To prevent trespassing and unauthorized access, students are not permitted to
self-register. All student accounts must be created exclusively by the Registrar
Department using official student ID, institutional email address, and National ID or
Passport number. Login credentials are securely handed over to students after account
creation.
5. Authentication and Login
Users authenticate using official email addresses and passwords. The system
automatically detects whether the user is a student or staff member based on email
domain and stored role. Students are required to change their password upon first login.
6. Faculty-Based Registration Routing (NEW RULE)
All registration submissions must be automatically routed to the student’s designated
faculty. Faculty assignment is done at account creation by the Registrar and cannot be
modified by the student. Registrations are visible only to staff members belonging to the
same faculty. Cross-faculty access or approval is strictly prohibited.
7. Student Registration Workflow
1 Student logs in and confirms profile details
2 Student selects semester and academic year
3 System loads faculty-approved modules automatically
4 Student confirms all required modules
5 Registration is submitted and routed to designated faculty
8. Approval Workflow
Registration approval follows a mandatory sequential workflow and cannot be bypassed:
1 Year Leader approval (same faculty as student)
2 Faculty Admin approval (same faculty as student)
3 Finance Department approval
4 Registrar final approval
9. Notifications
The system automatically sends email and SMS notifications to students at submission,
each approval stage, and upon final approval.
10. Security Requirements
1 Registrar-only student account creation
2 Faculty-based access control enforcement
3 Password hashing and forced first-login password change
4 Audit logs for approvals and account creation
5 Login attempt limits to prevent abuse
11. Expected Deliverables
1 Fully functional faculty-routed online registration system
2 Role-based staff and student dashboards
3 Email and SMS notification services
4 User and technical documentation
5 Secure and scalable database design
